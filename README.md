## General Information
- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential 
to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Goal : Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma

## Conclusions
- Model 1 (Base Model) - Observed Overfitting 
- Model 2 (With Data Augmentation + Dropouts) - Fixed Overfit but observed underfit 
- Model 3 (Fixed Class Imbalance by adding 500 images to each class using Augmentor + BN + 50 epochs (as recommended in notebook) + FC = 256) - 
Class Rebalance helped to increase the Train and Validation accuracy but could be further improved by increasing the parameters of Dense layer to 512 as below. 
- Model 3 (Fixed Class Imbalance by adding 500 images to each class using Augmentor + BN + 50 epochs (as recommended in notebook) + FC = 512) -
has better Train and Validation accuracy
